# Hangman

I've developed an engaging Hangman CLI game in Ruby, that comes complete with a save and load game feature.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the game directory in your terminal.
3. Run the game by executing the `ruby hangman.rb` command.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to guess letters and solve the word puzzle.
5. Enjoy the game and strive to reveal the word before running out of attempts!

## Save and Load

Never worry about losing your progress. The game allows you to save your current game and load it whenever you're ready to continue. Just follow these steps:

1. While in the game, choose the **Save Game** option from the menu.
2. Your game will be saved in a file.
3. When you're back to play, select the **Load Game** option to resume your previous session.

## Acknowledgements

This Hangman CLI game project is inspired by the [Ruby Hangman lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hangman) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), an open-source curriculum for learning web development.

Enjoy the game, and happy word-guessing!
